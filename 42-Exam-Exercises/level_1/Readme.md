# Level 1 – Exam Programming Fundamentals - 42 Common Core Exam

This repository contains solutions for **Level 1** exercises of the **42 Common Core Exam**.  
Level 1 focuses on validating **C fundamentals**, **string manipulation**, and **basic algorithmic logic**, strictly following **42 Norm**.

## Exercises

- `first_word` – Print the first word of a string
```
Assignment name  : first_word
Expected files   : first_word.c
Allowed functions: write

Write a program that takes a string and displays its first word, followed by a
newline.

A word is a section of string delimited by spaces/tabs or by the start/end of
the string.

If the number of parameters is not 1, or if there are no words, simply display
a newline.
```
 
- `ft_putstr` – Output a string to stdout
```
Assignment name  : ft_putstr
Expected files   : ft_putstr.c
Allowed functions: write

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its
letters by the letter 13 spaces ahead in alphabetical order.

'z' becomes 'm' and 'Z' becomes 'M'. Case remains unaffected.

The output will be followed by a newline.

If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays a newline.
```
- `rotone` – Rotate characters by one
```
Assignment name  : rotone
Expected files   : rotone.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its
letters by the next one in alphabetical order.

'z' becomes 'a' and 'Z' becomes 'A'. Case remains unaffected.

The output will be followed by a \n.

If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays \n.
```
- `search_and_replace` – Replace characters in a string
```
Assignment name  : search_and_replace
Expected files   : search_and_replace.c
Allowed functions: write, exit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program called search_and_replace that takes 3 arguments, the first
arguments is a string in which to replace a letter (2nd argument) by
another one (3rd argument).

If the number of arguments is not 3, just display a newline.

If the second argument is not contained in the first one (the string)
then the program simply rewrites the string followed by a newline.
```
- `ulstr` – Toggle uppercase and lowercase characters
```
Assignment name  : ulstr
Expected files   : ulstr.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string and reverses the case of all its letters.
Other characters remain unchanged.

You must display the result followed by a '\n'.

If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays '\n'.
```

## Constraints

- Language: **C**
- Norminette compliant
- No forbidden functions
- Exam-oriented implementation

## Goal

This level prepares students for the **first Common Core exam** by covering essential logic patterns and string operations required to pass.
